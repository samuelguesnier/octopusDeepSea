                <p>Oil prospection is an important part of Octopus Deep Sea. What started as a one-time job when we worked with a big oil company 4 years ago has since transformed itself in one of our most important activities. It is an amazing way for us to work together with oil companies in helping them find huge and unknown oil sources. We now work with big oil companies on a yearly basis around the globe with their teams and our team of experts, sharing our respective skills and technical expertise.

                <p>Octopus Deep Sea has the chance to be working with well-known universities and research labs around the world since its creation. Our numerous partnerships have helped discover already 23 species, including 3 in Manille Trench and Ryukyu Trench in 2014 and 2016, and raise the importance of preserving the ocean biodiversity. Scientific expeditions often include sampling and photography of unknown species with universities teams composed of PhD students and professors, in addition to our employees."

            <h2>Wreck exploration</h2>
            <hr>
            <div class="elements">
                <p>Wreck exploration is part in many dreams. Our firm's photography and submarine teams work with associations to explore historical wrecks, with the main goal of educating our society on the secrets of oceans.<br/><br/>Our most famous exploration is the Bismark wreck, which was the 1st Kriegsmarine's ironclad during the WWII. Sunk in 1941, it's one of the many case studies for oceanographic institutes today.<br/><br/>For technical equipment reasons, we are not able to go deeper than 5000 meters below sea level, which is already enough. Most people never go below 4000 meters so the additional kilometer helps us discover a non-negligeable percentage of remaining untouched wrecks.</p>

                <img class="elementsH" src="img/assitance.jpg" />
                <p>Our last pillar of experience is Accident assistance. In case of an accident, we can do deep sea assistance to find wrecks or specific things like lost freight or wreckage. In most cases, we help airlines or governments find for example flight recorders in wrecks. This is under no circumstances a 24/7 accident assistance. We are helping our clients after the accident, not during it.</p>
